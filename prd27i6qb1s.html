<div> </div><div><b>Methodology</b></div><div>I perform Local Outlier Factor (LOF) approach to find out outliers. In python, we have a package for LOF provided in scikit-learn. First, LOF defines local density which is calculated by 1 divided by the sum of mean distances to k-nearest neighbors. Then, the algorithm detects outliers, which have low local density compared with other observations. I chose LOF because there are only a few approaches to detect outliers in high-dimension and it has high interpretability. </div>
