<div><b>&nbsp;</b></div><div><b>Abstract: </b></div><div>In this paper, we will try to find out outlier neighborhoods in terms of rent price, safety, and commuting time to city centers. We assume that market price in terms of rent is not all the time perfect and there could be some neighborhoods which are undervalued. Exploring NYC rent data, NYC crime data, and google map, we apply Local Outlier Factor approach, which was introduced by Breunig, Kriegel, Ng, &amp; Sander (2000). </div><div>As a result, we found seven outliers, which might be undervalued or overvalued and concluded that Little Italy, Battery Park, and Murray Hill (Manhattan) are good deals to live. On the other hand, East New York, Bedford Stuyvesant, and Tribeca might be overvalued. </div><div>we should note a limitation. Since we set two specific destinations to calculate commuting time from each neighborhood, these conclusions, i.e. overvalued or undervalued, are not applied people who have to commute different destinations. <span></span></div><div><b>&nbsp;</b></div><div><b>Introduction: </b></div><div>Looking for affordable rooms, many people in NYC live outside city centers and commute to the centers. Generally speaking, rent price is correlated with distance to city centers and quality of the neighborhood. In this project, we will try to find outlier areas where rent is cheap but close to city centers and safe. This information about outliers is useful for people looking for investment opportunity on real estate and city agencies which care about areas where gentrification would happen near future by Adam Smithâ€™s invisible hand.</div><div>Using Local Outlier Factor, we will try to detect the outliers. First, we will collect and clean data. Then, I will explain what the Local Outlier Factor is and analyze the results we got. Then, we will explore the potential improvement of this research as a future work.<span></span></div><div>The relation among rent price, crime and location has been already well researched. For example, Zhang &amp; Hite (2015) performed regressions and found out that correlations between crime counts and housing price when people choose accommodation. However, researches which are applied high-dimensional clustering to investigate the relation among rent, crime and location are still undeveloped. The value of our research is that we conduct statistical research and perform 3-dimensional clustering approach to detect outlier rent, which is unique.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>&nbsp;</b></div><div><b>Data: </b></div><div>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Datasets</div><div>We are focusing on three features; Rent, Crimes, and Commuting time. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>1. Rent price by neighborhood. We use Zillow Rental Listings data which shows median rent price by neighborhood and room size. we use rent price for studio by neighborhood level. Accordingly, we use Zillow Neighborhood Boundaries which is a shape file provided by Zillow. we use rent price as of February 2017. We note that rent price data of some neighborhoods are missing, and we treat them as missing (i.e. no interpolation methods). </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>2. Crime. We can use NYPD Complaint Data Historic which describes every crime with longitude and latitude data by category of crime. In this project, I extract felony crime data as it has serious impacts on neighborhoods and we have enough number of samples for it. The data was generated between 2016-01 and 2018-02. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>3. Commuting time to city centers from each neighborhood. As we use zone data for rent, we need to have a representative commuting time for each neighborhood (it is impossible to calculate the time from the infinite number of locations). I calculate the centroid of each polygon (GeoSeries.centroid in python) and define it as an origin. Then, using google map, I calculate commuting time. Google map has a function to calculate the fastest route when we put an origin and a destination. </div><div>We set two destinations; Midtown = Times Square and Financial District = New York Stock Exchange, and took the shortest time to reach destinations by train/bus/walk. To get/scrape the commuting time from each origin to destinations, I used selenium. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data procurements</div><div>To clean data is the largest part of this project. Basically, I combined data discussed above by join or spatial join. For reproducibility, I note a tricky cleaning process. Zillow Rental Listings data has duplicated but slightly different rows, which should be deleted. For example, we have two Murray Hill in NYC and the data has four Murray Hill wrongly, in which each of them is categorized into the different borough.<span></span></div><div>After the cleaning, we got 64 neighborhoods in which each row has a neighborhood name, rent price, felony counts, commuting times to Times Square and NYSE, and geometry/Polygon. Figure 1 shows the cleaned data in the form of heatmaps. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Figure 1. Heatmap for 4 features</div>
