<div><b>&nbsp;Abstract: </b></div><div>In this paper, I will try to find out outlier neighborhoods in terms of rent price, safety, and commuting time to city centers. I assume that market price in terms of rent is not all the time perfect and there could be some neighborhoods which are undervalued. Exploring NYC rent data, NYC crime data, and google map, I apply Local Outlier Factor approach, which was introduced by Breunig, Kriegel, Ng, &amp; Sander (2000). </div><div>As a result, I found seven outliers, which might be undervalued or overvalued and concluded that Little Italy, Battery Park, and Murray Hill (Manhattan) are good deals to live. On the other hand, East New York, Bedford Stuyvesant, and Tribeca might be overvalued. </div><div>I should note a limitation. Since I set two specific destinations to calculate commuting time from each neighborhood, these conclusions, i.e. overvalued or undervalued, are not applied people who have to commute different destinations. </div><div></div><div><b>&nbsp;</b></div><div><b>Introduction: </b></div><div>Looking for affordable rooms, many people in NYC live outside city centers and commute to the centers. Generally speaking, rent price is correlated with distance to city centers and quality of the neighborhood. In this project, we will try to find outlier areas where rent is cheap but close to city centers and safe. This information about outliers is useful for people looking for investment opportunity on real estate and city agencies which care about areas where gentrification would happen near future by Adam Smithâ€™s invisible hand.</div><div>Using Local Outlier Factor, we will try to detect the outliers. First, we will collect and clean data. Then, I will explain what the Local Outlier Factor is and analyze the results we got. Then, we will explore the potential improvement of this research as a future work.</div><div>The relation among rent price, crime and location has been already well researched. For example, Zhang &amp; Hite (2015) performed regressions and found out that correlations between crime counts and housing price when people choose accommodation. However, researches which are applied high-dimensional clustering to investigate the relation among rent, crime and location are still undeveloped. The value of our research is that we conduct statistical research and perform 3-dimensional clustering approach to detect outlier rent, which is unique.</div><div></div>
