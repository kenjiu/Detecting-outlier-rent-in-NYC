<div><b>Analysis/Conclusion</b></div><div>The figure below shows the seven outliers. Coincidently, I got exactly same outliers while I tried two patterns; one is rent/felony/commuting time to Times Square, and another is rent/felony/commuting time to NYSE. Outliers can be categorized into two; reasonable rent neighborhood (undervalued) and unreasonable rent neighborhood (overvalued) for people commuting those two areas.&nbsp;</div><div>In my analysis, Little Italy, Battery Park, and Murray Hill (Manhattan) show low numbers of felony attacks and commuting time for rent. Therefore, I can say these three areas are good to rent if one commutes to the Financial District or Midtown. </div><div>East New York and Bedford Stuyvesant show about 4 times higher felony counts than average. However, rents of those are close to average, and thus I can say these areas are overvalued. </div><div>Rent in Tribeca is about 2.6 times higher than average while commuting times for both destinations and felony counts are low. Comparing these numbers with those of Murray Hill (Manhattan), rent in Tribeca is 2 times higher than that of Murray Hill while other features are quite similar. Therefore, these factors imply that Tribeca is an outlier because the rent of that is quite higher than the others. Many people would choose Murray Hill over Tribeca under our assumptions.</div><div>Interpretation for Sunnyside (Staten) would be controversial. Sunnyside has a very small number of felony attacks and low rent price. The algorithm might detect those factors as outliers. On the other hand, in figure 2, I can see a quite high number in commuting time to Times Square from Sunnyside. Usually, we donâ€™t need 47 minutes from NYSE to Times Square, and 83 minutes is a quite high number, compared with that for NYSE, 36 minutes from Sunnyside. It might be caused because of the timing of scraping the data since the ferry departure from Manhattan to Staten is every 30 minutes. Or, some traffic accident or delay might cause such a high number. </div>
