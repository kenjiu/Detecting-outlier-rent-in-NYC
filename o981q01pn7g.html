<div></div><div></div><div><b>Future work</b></div><div>In this project, we found out 7 outliers, and only three of them are located outside of Manhattan. I expected that we can find more outliers outside of Manhattan. Because in outer boroughs, accessibility to public transportation has a huge variance. While MTA subway is spread all over Manhattan, some of the areas in outer borough areas do not have access to subway. </div><div>One possible explanation for this is that the market mechanism perfectly controls rent price based on features we used. Another possibility is that sample size (64) is too small. For further research, we could use different rent datasets other than Zillow data. </div><div>Also, I should consider using different models such as K-NN.</div>
