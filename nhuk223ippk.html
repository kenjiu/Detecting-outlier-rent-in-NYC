<div></div><div>Rent: Studio rent in dollar scale (Zillow). Crime: The number of felony crimes (NYPD). Time to Times Square and NYSE: Commuting time on a minute scale. </div><div>Rent prices in central Manhattan are the highest, and as it goes outer boroughs, the prices go down. Crime counts are randomly spread, but southeast Brooklyn and northern Manhattan show hubs of crimes. Commuting time is almost concentrically spread, but some outer boroughs such as eastern Queens do not follow this rule, which can be outliers. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>Methodology</b></div><div>We perform Local Outlier Factor (LOF) approach to find out outliers. In python, we have a package for LOF provided in scikit-learn. First, LOF defines local density which is calculated by 1 divided by the sum of mean distances to k-nearest neighbors. Then, the algorithm detects outliers, which have low local density compared with other observations. I chose LOF because there are only a few approaches to detect outliers in high-dimension and it has high interpretability. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>Analysis/Conclusion</b></div><div>The figure below shows the seven outliers. Coincidently, I got exactly same outliers while I tried two patterns; one is rent/felony/commuting time to Times Square, and another is rent/felony/commuting time to NYSE. Outliers can be categorized into two; reasonable rent neighborhood (undervalued) and unreasonable rent neighborhood (overvalued) for people commuting those two areas. </div><div>In my analysis, Little Italy, Battery Park, and Murray Hill (Manhattan) show low numbers of felony attacks and commuting time for rent. Therefore, we can say these three areas are good to rent if one commutes to the Financial District or Midtown. </div><div>East New York and Bedford Stuyvesant show about 4 times higher felony counts than average. However, rents of those are close to average, and thus we can say these areas are overvalued. </div><div>Rent in Tribeca is about 2.6 times higher than average while commuting times for both destinations and felony counts are low. Comparing these numbers with those of Murray Hill (Manhattan), rent in Tribeca is 2 times higher than that of Murray Hill while other features are quite similar. Therefore, these factors imply that Tribeca is an outlier because the rent of that is quite higher than the others. Many people would choose Murray Hill over Tribeca under our assumptions.</div><div>Interpretation for Sunnyside (Staten) would be controversial. Sunnyside has a very small number of felony attacks and low rent price. The algorithm might detect those factors as outliers. On the other hand, in figure 2, we can see a quite high number in commuting time to Times Square from Sunnyside. Usually, we donâ€™t need 47 minutes from NYSE to Times Square, and 83 minutes is a quite high number, compared with that for NYSE, 36 minutes from Sunnyside. It might be caused because of the timing of scraping the data since the ferry departure from Manhattan to Staten is every 30 minutes. Or, some traffic accident or delay might cause such a high number. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Figure 2 Outliers detected by LOF and means of each feature</div><div> &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;<table><tbody><tr><td>  &nbsp;   &nbsp;    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;<table><tbody><tr><td>    &nbsp;<div>    &nbsp;<div>Mean</div>    &nbsp;</div>    &nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div>Note: To_Square, To_NYSE shows commuting time on the minute scale.
